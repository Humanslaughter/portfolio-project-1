## UX
I wanted it to be something simple for both new and returning visitors to navigate through and find whateber they're looking for when it comes to my content thanks
to the menu at the top of the screen.
They can easily find my contact info like social media on both the page "Contact" and in the footer, all clickable links that will lead them to my social media
via a new tab.

### Design
#### Colour Scheme
- Blue and black, which is the two main colours that I use for my brand/logo.

#### Typography
- Body: Fauna One (sarif).
- h1, h2: Cinzel (sarif).

#### Imagery
- All taken and edited by me, I've also designed the logotype image seen in "About" and "Contact".

## Features
- Responsive on a lot of various device sizes with interactive elements.
